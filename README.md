# About Doddle Learn

Doddle is a discontinued education technology platform. It was an online teaching, homework and assessment resource, containing thousands of ready-made, self-marking resources across all subjects at KS3 and KS4. These are some of the projects I worked on:

The UI template wrapper used for the interactive activities is inside the [Interactive Template folder](/Interactive%20Template/). This template has replaceable placeholders and a link to the URL of Font Awesome CSS which is used for rendering the icons at the bottom of the page.

## 1. 24 Hour Clock Activity

A math exercise that also helps with learning French numbers. It allows the user to adjust the hands of a clock and displays the translation of the time into French.

> [Project Files](/24-hour%20Clock%20Activity/).

## 2. Addition Pyramid

This is a math exercise that teaches basic addition by using a pyramid. The user can click on a note to reveal a number. Numbers that are adjacent to each other determine the value of the number above them. The numbers are generate using the JavaScript `Math.random` function.

> [Project Files](/Addition%20Pyramid/)

## 3. Addition Square

A math exercise that shows the result of adding numbers both negative and positive. The numbers are displayed in a table where the value of each cell is determined by adding the numbers at the top of the column and at the beginning of the row.

> [Project Files](/Addition%20Square/)

## 4. Area of a Trapezium

In this math exercise, the learner drags the points of a trapezium to the left and right. The height of the trapezium can be changed by dragging the orange lines up and down. The trapezium has a right angle to represent 90 degrees.

> [Project Files](/Area%20of%20a%20Trapezium/)

## 5. Blox Game Fractions Calculations

A class activity that focuses on mathematical fractions and can be done by team members. The user can click a number on a grid to see a question, click to show an answer, and select a color to mark each question.

> [Project Files](/Blox%20game%20Fraction%20calculations/)

## 6. Building 3D Shapes

In this activity, the user builds 3D shapes using cubes by clicking a cube to attach another to it. A color palette is available to choose the color of the shapes. The 3D shapes can be rotated in space using the mouse wheel. This project uses jQuery for DOM manipulation.

> [Project Files](/Building%203D%20Shapes/)

## 7. Calculating Gradients

This is a math exercise that uses an SVG element to display a graph. The user drags the points on the line to change the gradient and view the calculations at the bottom of the page. This project uses jQuery and FPSMeter.

> [Project Files](/Calculating%20Gradients/)

## 8. Changing Sectors of a Pie Chart

In this project, a pie chart with different colored sections is shown. The user can press and drag the division marks on the pie chart or click and drag the little circle to change the size of the sectors. The plus and minus icons in the table at the bottom can also adjust the size of the sectors of the pie chart. This project uses jQuery and a custom library called _Draggable Pie chart_.

> [Project Files](/Changing%20sectors%20of%20a%20pie%20chart/)

## 9. Circle Circumference and Diameter

This activity teaches learners about the diameter and circumference of a circle. The user can drag the point at the right to change the circle's size and press the notelets to show the circumference and the diameter of the circle.

> [Project Files](/Circle%20Circumference%20and%20Diameter/)

## 10. Coordinates Game

This game/activity renders a graph with a Y and X axis. 2 players can plot balls on specific coordinates using the controls for the respective color. The game logic aborts the game when one of the colors are plotted 3 times in a row.

> [Project Files](/Coordinates%20Game/)

## 11. Fraction Counter

This activity teaches learners about fractions using a clock. The user can select a numerator and denominator referred to as the "step size". These two numeric values are divided with each other to come up with the value that will be displayed as a fraction.

> [Project Files](/Fraction%20Counter/)

## 12. German Calculator

This activity shows a calculator, allowing the user to enter a numeric expression and have the result shown in German numeric words.

> [Project Files](/German%20Calculator/)

## 13. How Strong is the Centripetal Force

This activity allows a user to adjust the speed, mass, and radius for a truck that moves in a circular motion. Changing each of these has an impact of the movement of the truck e.g. increasing the mass slows it down.

> [Project Files](/How%20Strong%20is%20the%20Centripetal%20Force/)

## 14. Investigation Reflection

This activity renders a shape with its inverse reflection on the opposite side. The user is supposed to drag the points to change the shape which also changes the reflection.

> [Project Files](/Investigating%20Reflection/)

## 15. Making Symmetrical Shapes

This project uses a similar feature to the Investigation Reflection project above. The user can drag and adjust the shape using the different points around the shape. The orange vertical, horizontal, and diagonal dotted lines can be toggled using the numbers at the right. These lines can then be used to measure symmetry.

> [Project Files](/Making%20Symmetrical%20Shapes/)

## 16. Multiplying Algebraic Expressions

This project allows the user to generate algebraic expressions by clicking on the blue cells in the table. The numbers used for the expressions are randomly generated and fall between -9 and 9. The white cells cannot be clicked on unless the blue column for the respective column and row have been activated i.e. clicked on. The values displayed in the white cells represent the result of the algebraic expression.

> [Project Files](/Multiplying%20Algebraic%20Expressions/)

## 17. Noughts and Crosses Game

This project uses HTML data attributes and JavaScript to retrieve values from the respective elements. The activity has the following features:

- Click a number to select it.
- Click the notelet to reveal the correct answer.
- Click the nought or the cross to mark the highlighted number.

> [Project Files](/Noughts%20and%20Crosses%20Game/)

## 18. Reading Journals

This was part of an English lesson. The user interface renders a 3D book which uses JavaScript to apply a class that activates an animation that simulates turning over the page of a book. In this case, the class is called 'flipped'. The book's pages can be turned by clicking on either of its ends.

> [Project Files](/Reading%20Journals/)

## 19. Reflect the Shape

This project is very similar to [Investigation Reflection](#14-investigation-reflection). The numbered buttons at the right can be used to toggle the dotted orange lines of symmetry. The user can adjust the shapes using the controls that surround them. The shape adjustments are handled by browser event listeners for mouse movement after clicking on the circles around the shapes.

> [Project Files](/Reflect%20the%20Shape/)

## 20. The Muscular System

This is a science/biology lesson that studies the human muscle system. An instruction is shown and the user should click on the corresponding muscle from the human body diagram which activates a GIF file for the respective body movement.

> [Project Files](/The%20Muscular%20System/)

## 21. Translation Golf Game

This is a mini-golf simulation that teaches math and coordinates. The user can select the amount they wish to move the ball by in both X and Y directions. Clicking on the "GO" button moves the ball to simulate a golf stroke. The boundaries of the page handle collision detection ensuring that the golf ball does not go off the screen. This project uses P5.js and [Matter.js](https://brm.io/matter-js/) for physics.

> [Project Files](/Translation%20Golf%20Game/)

## 22. Transverse & Longitudinal Waves

A physics lesson that teaches two fundamental types of waves that differ in how the particles move and allows the user to select a type of wave to simulate. Transverse waves move vertically while longitudinal waves move horizontally although their individual particles may not. The page for each type of wave allows the user to adjust values such as amplitude, wave length, and frequency to see the how the waves behave under different conditions.

> [Project Files](/Transverse%20and%20Longitudinal%20Waves/)

## 23. Walk The Turtle

This interactive activity allows the user to move a tortoise based on its surroundings. In this case, the tortoise can be made to move 1 meter away from a tree, equally from two plants, or along the fence.

> [Project Files](/Walk%20the%20Turtle/)

## 24. Where is Spanish Spoken

This project teaches learners about the different parts of the world where the Spanish language is spoken. A world map is rendered and the countries that speak Spanish are highlighted in yellow. This project uses [amCharts](https://www.amcharts.com/) for rendering the world map.
