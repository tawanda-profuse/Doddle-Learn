Doddle is a discontinued education technology platform. It was an online teaching, homework and assessment resource, containing thousands of ready-made, self-marking resources across all subjects at KS3 and KS4.

These are some of the projects I worked on:

## 1. 24 Hour Clock Activity

A math exercise for students trying to learn French. It allows the user to adjust the hands of a clock and displays the translation of the time into French. The relevant files are in the [respective folder](/24-hour%20Clock%20Activity/).
